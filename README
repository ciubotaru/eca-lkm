eca-lkm
=======

eca-lkm is a Linux kernel module (LKM) that provides a pseudo-random number
generator (PRNG) based on an elementary cellular automaton (ECA) that
follows Wolfram's Rule 30.

Installation
------------

Building a kernel module requires properly configures kernel source and headers.
To compile eca-lkm from source code:

$ make

To install the newly-built module into the module tree (will need root privileges, e.g. with 'sudo -E'):

$ make modules_install

To load the installed module:

$ modprobe eca30

or, alternatively, to load it from the source tree:

$ insmod eca30.ko

This will create a new character device, /dev/eca30.

Usage
-----

Reading from /dev/eca30 produces random numbers. Writing to /dev/eca30 changes
the internal state of ECA ("random pool").
