eca-lkm
=======

eca-lkm is a Linux kernel module (LKM) that provides a pseudo-random number
generator (PRNG) based on an elementary cellular automaton (ECA) that
follows Wolfram's Rule 30.

Installation
------------

Building a kernel module requires properly configures kernel source and headers.
To compile eca-lkm from source code:

$ make

To install the newly-built module into the module tree (will need root privileges, e.g. with 'sudo -E'):

$ make modules_install

To load the installed module:

$ modprobe eca30

or, alternatively, to load it from the source tree:

$ insmod eca30.ko

This will create a new character device, /dev/eca30.

udev
----

To have a device with proper attributes created under /dev when your module
is loaded, copy the file named 99-eca30.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d

$ mkdir -p /etc/udev/rules.d

$ cp 99-eca30.rules /etc/udev/rules.d

dkms
----

To have your module automatically rebuilt with every kernel update, you can
install DKMS and use it to manage your module.

Under /usr/src create a directory named eca30-0.0.1 and copy the source files
into it. Then install the module:

$ dkms install -m eca30 -v 0.0.1

Usage
-----

Reading from /dev/eca30 produces random numbers. Writing to /dev/eca30 changes
the internal state of ECA ("random pool").
